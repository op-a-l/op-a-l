- 👋 Hi, I’m @op-a-l
- 🎚️ I love music related things such as Bitwig, Max 9 and Ableton.
- 👀 I’m interested in web devlopment with sveltekit and I'd love to learn low level DSP to build my very own open source music devices.
- 🌱 I’m currently making Max 9 things, websites and random js stuff.
- 🎯 I work on sound design in experimental electronic music and bass music.
